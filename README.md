# Epoxy-Tables-NH-

This GitHub repository contains the source code and files for the business website I developed for Epoxy Tables NH. The website is designed to showcase the exquisite epoxy tables and furniture crafted by Epoxy Tables NH. It features a responsive and user-friendly design, allowing visitors to explore the stunning products, learn more about the craftsmanship, and get in touch with the business. It includes About Us page with sections About, Products, Projects, Services, Gallery, Reviews. Expect that it includes Contact Us, Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions and FAQs. This repository includes HTML, CSS, JS and other assets used in building the website. Feel free to explore the page on this <a href="https://epoxytablesnh.com/">link</a>
